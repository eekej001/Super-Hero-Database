Furthermore, it is widely known that his subordinates are in fact more powerful than he could ever hope to be.  But who are we kidding?  That's not really saying much.  For a time he believed that no could tell if you were crying if you were underwater.  He was sorely mistaken.  Scientists are still trying to discover how it's possible for one being to hold so many L's.",
